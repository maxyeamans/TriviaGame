# TriviaGame

## What it does

This is a run-of-the-mill trivia game, based on a movie franchise that I hold near and dear to my heart: Star Wars.

After pressing the start button, you'll get a barrage of questions about the Star Wars universe, and you'll have 8 seconds to answer each one. There are variables in the code to change both the number of questions and how many seconds you have to answer.

## Stuff left to do

- [ ] Refactor the code to display an image rather than an alert on question answer.
    - This image should disappear after the user guesses their first letter on a new game.
- [ ] Add code to play a sound when the game is over.
- [ ] Fix the damn button at the end so that it restarts the game.
- [ ] Stylize the text more.
    - I need to find a suitable web font to make it more Star Wars-y.
- [ ] Add buttons to select a difficulty
    - The buttons will be for Easy, Normal, and Hard mode. The difficulty will change the amount of time for each guess. Easy is 10 seconds, Normal is 8, Hard is 6.
